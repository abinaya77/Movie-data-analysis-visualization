# Movie-data-analysis-visualization
I have used jupyter notebook to analyse the movie data .I have preformed several tasks including 
cleaning data like 
filling values ,
changing min to hr ,
changing the scale values ,
splitting a text column into two or more etc.

For the analysis part 

1)I hv found the genre on trend based on several factors

2)i hv found the overall best performing actor based on several factors.
